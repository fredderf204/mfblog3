So I survived my first Ignite as a speaker :microphone:

Not so much survived, but I have a great time :tada: connecting with my peers and having some great discussion about Azure :cloud:, Delivery Pipelines and Node.js. Ignite is one my favorite :heart: technical events of the year.

If you missed Microsoft Ignite Australia or couldn't make the event :cry:, don't worry :worried: you won't miss out on the content :smiley: All of the session recordings and slide decks are available at [here](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Ignite/Australia-2017)

Also you can view my sessions directly below;
