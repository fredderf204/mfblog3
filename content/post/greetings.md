Hello... it's just become a new year :tada::balloon: and I have decided I am going to start a blog. 

I know this is not particulary original, but I enjoy tinkering around with a lot of different tech in the cloud, and this blog is going to a way for me to share my experiences.

I look forward to sharing with you some of the cool and sometimes quirky things I get up to in the cloud.
