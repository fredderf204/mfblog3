I am a passionate technologist, who specialises in "The Cloud":cloud:. In my current role at Microsoft, I enable Microsoft partners for success on the Azure platform.

I enjoy exploring and building all types of technologies in the cloud. Although there is way to much cool tech to play with, my current interests include;

    1. Cloud Application Development
    2. Automated Deployments
    3. Node.js
    4. Containers

Outside of work I am a big sports fan! I love to watch Cricket, Rubgy League:rugby_football: and Soccer:soccer:
